### Benjamin Pedigo

I am a third-year PhD candidate in the Deparment of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. I am advised by Joshua Vogelstein in the [NeuroData lab](https://neurodata.io/). My work focuses on using statistical and computational techniques to help understand nanoscale connectomes.

I am also a developer of [graspologic](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic) (formerly called GraSPy), an open-source Python package for doing statistical analyses of network data which we now co-develop with Microsoft Research. I am broadly interested in making data analysis techniques in neuroscience more accessible through open-source software.
